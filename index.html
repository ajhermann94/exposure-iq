    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>
    <p><strong>Exposure IQ</strong> is built with a "Privacy-First" philosophy. Our policy is simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, location data, or camera metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All exposure calculations are performed locally on your device. No data ever leaves your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Tracking:</strong> We do not use any analytics, advertising SDKs, or third-party trackers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions, you can contact the developer through the <a href="https://github.com/ajhermann94">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
