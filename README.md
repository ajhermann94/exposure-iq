**Exposure IQ** is a high-precision exposure expert system designed to bridge the gap between smartphone computational photography and professional DSLR/Mirrorless manual mechanics.

## 🚀 The Technical Edge: APEX-CAL™ Engine
Unlike generic light meters that provide a "neutral gray" average, Exposure IQ uses the proprietary **APEX-CAL™ Engine**. This logic is specifically calibrated for the 14+ stops of dynamic range found in modern CMOS and BSI sensors.

### Key Capabilities:
* **Scene-Specific Logic:** Algorithms tailored for Action, Portrait, Landscape, and Macro.
* **Clinical Exposure Values:** Prioritizes RAW file latitude to prevent highlight clipping and muddy shadows.
* **Smart Advice Tutor:** Provides real-time technical justification for every recommended setting, teaching the *physics* of the exposure triangle.

## 📸 Goal-Oriented Exposure Modes
Exposure IQ analyzes a scene's luminance and contrast to provide an optimized "recipe" based on your creative intent:

| Mode | Priority Logic | Ideal For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Action** | Shutter Speed (1/500s - 1/8000s) | Sports, Wildlife, Racing |
| **Portrait** | Aperture (Wide Open Focus) | Shallow Depth-of-Field |
| **Landscape** | Diffraction-Limited Aperture ($f/8 - f/11$) | Maximum Sharpness/Detail |
| **Macro** | Deep Field Depth ($f/13+$) | Close-up focus stacking |

## 🛠 Usage for DSLR/Mirrorless
1. **Calibrate:** Select your sensor type (Full-Frame/APS-C) and current ISO.
2. **Meter:** Point your device at the subject. Use **Spot Metering** for high-contrast scenes.
3. **Execute:** Transfer the recommended Aperture/Shutter settings to your camera's Manual (M) mode.
4. **Learn:** Tap the "Smart Advice" icon to understand why these settings were chosen for the current light.
